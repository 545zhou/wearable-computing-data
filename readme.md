I uploaded 5 files: readme.md, codebook.md,run_analysis.R,run_analysis.Rmd and run_analysis.html.

readme.md is the starting point of the introduction. This file briefly introduce what other files are.

codebook.md describes ther variables that are used in the tidy dataset.

run_analysis.R is the code script.

run_analysis.Rmd is the markdown file which combines boths code and text. It also generates 
run_analysis.html file.
