The 14 variables in the dataset are activity, person and the average values of the following variables: the mean of the body accelaration in 3 directions XYZ and their standard corresponding deviations, the mean of the angular accelartation in 3 directions XYZ and their standard deviations. I extracted the variable names from the features.txt file directly because their names are straightforward.
